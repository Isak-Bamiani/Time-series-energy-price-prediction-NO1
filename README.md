# Time-series-energy-price-prediction-NO1
 
The goal of this project is to create multivariate forecasting models using the direct one-step approach. These models aim to predict future values of the target variable, "Day-ahead Price EUR/MWh BZN|NO1," based on historical data. By incorporating both 1-hour and 24-hour lagged features, the models strive to improve prediction accuracy. The XGBoost algorithm, specifically the "XGBRegressor" class from the scikit-learn library, is utilized for training these models. Performance assessment is conducted by training the models on a subset of the data and evaluating their accuracy and generalization ability on another subset. The resulting models will provide valuable insights into the electricity market, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding production and consumption based on predicted price trends. Implementation of the models will be carried out using the Python ecosystem with Jupiter notebook files.
